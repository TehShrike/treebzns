# Catch up

Review ClientNameSearch and ClientPhoneSearch, make them use the same results component, make them look like other inputs.

- create a lead screen should have a "the billing address is different" button below the project address field
- regenerate "create a lead" implementation
- I'm not happy with the string-building happening in filter_clients.  I suspect it would be more efficient to check for every(tokens, token => some(address_fields, field => field.includes(token)))
	- or we could just make something smarter and more efficient.  CachedClient should contain something easier to search.  Like: a unique array of the all-numeric tokens (only check startsWith, not includes) and a unique array of all other tokens (use includes).
- Permissions
- Which email/sms triggers are necessary

## After the create-a-lead/project screens

Use the tree inventory.  Search it/filter.  Then show on a map.

# Sending sms/emails: queue

Work queue table with the work, `attempts` count, some way to mark it as claimed.

```sql
UPDATE ... SET claimed_at = NOW(), attempts = attempts + 1, next_attempt_at = NOW() + backoff WHERE id = ?
```

Use `waitUntil` in CFW to launch the worker to try to work that record after returning the response?

Cloudflare Cron Triggers run every minute, launch worker that attempts to work everything in the queue.

# Must-haves

Add screens descriptions for these, to motivate modeling and implementation.

- client billing
	- client card processing!
- ways for people to sign online – close rates CAN NOT get worse
- photos – probably markup
- sms, email notification
	- sms needs built-in chat UI somewhere.  Could it be the same UI as email?
	- probably need scheduling from day one
	- top priority: followups on estimates

# Little/vague stuff

- Input focus border needs to look the same everywhere (embrace the rounding I guess)
- Client page needs some kind of default filter so that it doesn't list everything – maybe "has open project" or something

# Customer-facing page for proposals/projects

# "Create A Lead" interface

- identify everything that needs to be an input when creating a lead - look at the schema
- basic text input

# Deploying

- Finish deploy
	- Add mysql user to prod database for CFW
	- add mysql environment variables to CFW
	- Wrangler deploy CFW from master

# Export/import

- Chrome extension
- Make `fetch` calls with cookies
- https://claude.ai/chat/a7d94343-6ef6-4cb4-9062-2b4796cf1e36
- some endpoint that clients and leads can be uploaded to

# some time

- auto-prettify
- Redirect to app after creating company
- livereload in browser
- safer migration deploys
	- set a variable when deploying
	- have a worker check that variable and pause prod api requests
	- run migration while paused
