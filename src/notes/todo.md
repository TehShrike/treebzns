# Model this!

Clocking employees in and out of jobs.  Tie their clock-in/clock-out records directly to the project_crew records.

# Must-haves

Add screens descriptions for these, to motivate modeling and implementation.

- client billing
	- client card processing!
- ways for people to sign online – close rates CAN NOT get worse
- photos – probably markup
- sms, email notification
	- sms needs built-in chat UI somewhere.  Could it be the same UI as email?
	- probably need scheduling from day one
	- top priority: followups on estimates

# Little/vague stuff

- Input focus border needs to look the same everywhere (embrace the rounding I guess)
- Client page needs some kind of default filter so that it doesn't list everything – maybe "has open project" or something

# Customer-facing page for proposals/projects

# "Create A Lead" interface

- identify everything that needs to be an input when creating a lead - look at the schema
- basic text input

# Deploying

- Finish deploy
	- Add mysql user to prod database for CFW
	- add mysql environment variables to CFW
	- Wrangler deploy CFW from master

# Export/import

- Chrome extension
- Make `fetch` calls with cookies
- https://claude.ai/chat/a7d94343-6ef6-4cb4-9062-2b4796cf1e36
- some endpoint that clients and leads can be uploaded to

# some time

- auto-prettify
- Redirect to app after creating company
- livereload in browser
- safer migration deploys
	- set a variable when deploying
	- have a worker check that variable and pause prod api requests
	- run migration while paused
